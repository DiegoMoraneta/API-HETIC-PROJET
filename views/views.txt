error.pug: This template extends a base layout (layout.pug) and defines content for displaying error messages. It displays a main message (message), an error status code (error.status), and a stack trace (error.stack) to provide detailed information about the error that occurred.
index.pug: Also extending the base layout, this template contains a form designed for users to generate a PDF report. The form includes fields for the file name, report title, company name, board ID, start date, and end date. It makes a POST request to /pdf upon submission. The form elements are styled with Bootstrap classes, indicating that the application uses Bootstrap for styling.
layout.pug: Serves as the base layout for the application. It defines the HTML structure, including the DOCTYPE, html, head, and body tags. The title is dynamically set by each page that extends this layout. It includes a link to the Bootstrap CSS from the Bootswatch Flatly theme and a custom stylesheet (style.css). The block content is a placeholder overridden by extending templates to insert page-specific content.
